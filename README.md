# avto.met

avto.met is a clone of the website avto.net, created as a school project. The design is extremely similar to the original site, but the entire backend is made by me. 

## Description
avto.met is a website where you can log in and post or view advertisements for cars. There are 2 account options (well 3 if you count admin as one :P) - individual or a company. 

You can post cars, edit them or delete your posts. Admins can also manage different brands, models, colors, etc.

## Installation

Download the files and place them in a folder. Import the database into MySQL. If you do not like the way the database is made I have also included the original .txp file for you to edit it to your liking!

Before your first use, you will have to add at least 1 city and the account types in MySQL by hand. You also have to add fuel types, gearboxes and car types. I did not make a special admin panel for those since they are pretty much the same all the time and they do not change.

Everything else can be done by an admin once you set one.

If you want to use the Google and Facebook login, you will have to request your own API key for both of them. Once you do that and replace it, it should work.

## Usage

Just log in and if your database is set correctly you are good to go!

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

## Language
The frontend is currently fully slovenian. If there is interest I can make it in english as well. 

Backend is fully english.
